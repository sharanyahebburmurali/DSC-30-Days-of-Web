                <h1>Non-Design Resources for Designers</h1>
                <p>AJ&Smart is an award-winning product design and innovation studio based in Berlin, Germany. With their expertise in using Design Sprints, they have worked with some of the biggest companies in the world to help them build better products faster. They work closely with Jake Knapp, the inventor of Design Sprints to continuously evolve and improve the Design Sprint to provide the best possible value to their customers. Their team is dedicated to creating the best products and services, without wasting time and on budget.</p>  

                <p>Today, I’m excited to share some of the resources that I’ve come across their on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeB_OpLspKJGiKv1CYkWFFw">YouTube</a> channel to deepen my understanding of digital products. I’m here to keep you updated on some amazing, not-so-obvious UX design resources, ones that are NOT related to design, that a lot of designers tend to overlook. If you are looking to level up your user experience design skills, these tools could potentially allow you to stand out to prospective employers because of your new-found comprehension of their business and marketing needs.</p> 


                <h2>Stratechery</h2>
                <p>If you’re interested in reading about technology and its cultural impact on the world, Stratechery provides an analysis of the strategy and business side of technology and media and the impact of technology on society. It’s an amazing platform that provides designers with a big picture of current and upcoming products and why certain acquisitions take place from a business perspective rather than a design perspective. Weekly articles are free, while three daily updates a week are for subscribers only.</p>
                <p>Weekly articles are free, while three daily updates a week are for subscribers only. A subscription that costs $12 a month or $120 a year. The site provides you with interesting insights on company acquisitions for instance, why would UBER consider buying GrubHub or why did Facebook choose to acquire Giphy and what would this mean for the future of their product? </p>
                <p>Ben Thompson, the author of this subscription-based website, also runs an extremely interesting podcast about tech and society called Exponent that I highly recommend you guys check out!</p> 


                <h2>Axios</h2>
                <p>Axios is also a business-driven tech website. They aim to deliver clear, smart, efficiently written stories to their audience and provide advertisers the quality attention they deserve. They cover subjects like politics, business, culture, science, and technology. All of these fields are in a constant state of collision with one another and they discuss the industries and opportunities these collisions bring about.</p>
                <p>Right now their content, like the rest of the world, is focused on the Covid-19 crisis. I’ve found Axios to be one of my favorite sources for tech news as it isn’t dripping in political agenda. </p>


                <h2>Ken Norton</h2>
                <p>If you’re currently learning the basics of UI/UX Design, one of the best things you could do for your career is to be informed about the work that product managers do. You will find that product managers are the ones delegating your work to you and it is essential that you understand the way your boss works. 
                Some of the best designers I know are very fluent in the world of product management. </p>
                <p>Ken Norton is a senior Operating Partner at GV where he leads investing operations and provides product and engineering support to GV’s portfolio companies. Before moving over to GV, Ken was a group product manager at Google. In his time at Google, Ken led product initiatives for Google Docs, Google Calendar, and Google Mobile Apps.
                Ken Norton’s website can provide you with a fantastic list of some product management reading recommendations. Some of my favorites so far have been ‘The Lean Startup’, by Eric Ries, ‘The Mythical Man-Month’ by Fredrick Brooks, and ‘The Innovator’s Dilemma’, by Clayton Christensen.</p>
                <p>I would also highly recommend the product management Reddit page, r/ProductManagement for a refreshing perspective on a new set of topics every week. For instance, I thoroughly enjoyed a post on what interviews for certain positions at specific companies can be like. In this case, it was an extremely informative post about what it’s like to interview for a product management position at Amazon.
                I check out this subreddit pretty much every single day when I’m in the mood to delve into discussions surrounding product management, design, and innovation.</p>


                <h2>Innovation Hackers</h2>
                <p>Facebook groups are a place for one’s followers/customers/readers to bond around their shared love for a certain brand/product/theme that you represent. It’s a place of discussion, weird memes, rallying around common causes, learning about various products, and it can allow members to get exclusive knowledge around a certain subject.</p>
                <p>I’m fully aware of how cheesy the name sounds and how much people hate using Facebook groups today. Innovation Hackers is a Facebook group I set up without too much consideration years ago and today, it’s extremely popular with designers and product managers all over the world. We have really interesting discussions with regards to the world of design and encourage questions on all sorts of topics. I highly recommend you guys check it out, I think you’ll find it incredibly informative.</p>


                <h2>Podcasts</h2>
                <p>Podcasts are one of the most intimate and powerful forms of media today. Video is up there too, but podcasting is so impactful because you can be doing whatever you normally do, wherever you are and a podcast could potentially be changing your life in the background.
                If you want to take your business to the next level, learn a new language, study philosophy, or just become a more well-rounded and interesting person in general, you should be listening to podcasts whenever you can.</p> 
                <p>By listening to hundreds of hours of experts talking about their respective fields, you can experience the equivalent of sitting through years of college. Perhaps this is an exaggeration, but I hope you understand what I’m saying. You can learn by being a proverbial fly on the wall as podcasters who have already experienced failures and successes shed light on their unique stories. The education and inspiration you absorb through your headset could potentially help you start a business or travel the world. If not resulting in an extremely large impact on your life, perhaps aid you by influencing your everyday thoughts and goals.</p>
                <p>The list of podcasts I’m listening to is constantly evolving. But as ‘non-design’ resources for designers, I have to recommend ‘The Marketing Secrets Show’, ‘Noah Kagan Presents’,’The Podcast Experience’ by Mind The Product, ‘Recode Decode’ and ‘Techmeme Ride Home’.</p>


                <h2>Techmeme</h2>
                <p>Techmeme is another one of my favorite tech news websites. In 2020, knowing what’s evolving in technology is essential in understanding the current cultural and business climate that’s taking the world by storm. Techmeme is a leading source to keep track of current changes.
                It presents readers with a summary of the day’s essential reports with an analysis on a single page. It spotlights the writings of reporters, commentators, and industry players from all across the media landscape. By doing so, they spare readers the impossible task of constantly monitoring an abundance of news sites and updates.
                That’s all for now! </p>
                <p>I hope you find some of these resources beneficial to your design journey. Feel free to share some of your favorite resources. 
                What tools that aren’t design-oriented, have you found to substantially benefit you as a designer?</p>
