                <h1>30 Days of Web development</h1>
                <p>In a friend circle, triangle, or duo, each person has specific characteristics and traits. Some of them endearing and some of them drive you up a wall. There are friends who always share their food, or twitch their ears when they laugh or cry easily. Then, there are friends who are constantly in a never-ending spiral about how they never wanted to take up engineering and they need everyone in their life to know about it. I am that friend.</p>
                <p>While lessons taught at college are monotonous, lack-luster, and downright depressing if I'm being honest, I often forget  (or I'm too lazy to remember) that this isn't always a reflection of the subject matter. During the last year that's so drastically changed the world, stuck at home with nothing to do I watched a couple of basic web design tutorials on youtube and enjoyed it enough to practice along with the instructors as they displayed across their screens a blank slate being turned into something much more.</p><p>However, as much as I enjoyed the potential that a few lines of code could possess to create something beautiful and functional, not only did I lack the discipline to actually commit to practicing what I was learning but also the structure to guide me through a fulfilling learning experience. Still, I was just starting to realise that perhaps in the world of computer science and information technology there was actually a space that I would like to be a part of.</p>
                <p>It’s for that reason that I truly appreciate the time and effort that went into this initiative to bring to students across the country, structured content with the goal of introducing them to web development. Having had just about the smallest amount of my basics covered with HTML and CSS with random videos online, I can’t say that the course was completely beginner-friendly, especially when moving into javascript; something so very new to me. Certain parts were quite a struggle. However, it did force me to scour, not only the content you guys provided me, but also other sources across the internet and try things for myself, which I believe is the best way to learn and retain knowledge.</p><p>I can see that the work that was put into all this was monumental and I truly appreciate all the thinking that went into delivering such a great initiative to people, from live sessions to content on GitHub, vigilant doubt clearing on Discord, and the manner in which the projects were planned out. I really enjoyed working on them and learning more in time for the next project just as I would wrap up with the last.</p>
                <p>The <i>30 Days of Web Development</i> program was a super fun opportunity to practice and <strong>drastically</strong> (I can’t stress just how drastically)  improve on my basics and get a taste of what more I could learn to build and create amazing websites. I’m glad I was able to commit to finishing.</p>
                <p>Thank you for a great start to the year!</p>
